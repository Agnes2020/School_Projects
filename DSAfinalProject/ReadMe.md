#Data Structures and Algorithms Final Project
#Project Outline
My project is designed for a property renting app and in this case both houses and land. 
The code makes a distinction between the main user of the app and a normal user such that 
the activities of the main user cannot be allowed to the normal user. The main user can update properties,
view total the total revenue made, view details about properties as well as perform activities
designed for the normal user. To be able to do this, the code allows the main user to use a username
and password to access these services. On the contrary, the normal user can only view properties 
and be able to rent them. It uses different data storage methods as taught in class sessions.
